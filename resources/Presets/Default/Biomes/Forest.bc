# A mobgroups is made of four parts; mob name, weight, min and max.
# - Mob name is one of the Minecraft internal mob names. See http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Chunk_format#Mobs
# - Weight is used for a random selection. Must be a positive number.
# - Min is the minimum amount of mobs spawning as a group. Must be a positive number.
# - Max is the maximum amount of mobs spawning as a group. Must be a positive number.

# Mob groups are written to the config files as Json.
# Json is a tree document format: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON
# Syntax: {"mob": "mobname", "weight": integer, "min": integer, "max": integer}
# Example: {"mob": "minecraft:ocelot", "weight": 10, "min": 2, "max": 6}
# Example: {"mob": "minecraft:mooshroom", "weight": 5, "min": 2, "max": 2}
# A json list of mobgroups looks like this: [ mobgroup, mobgroup, mobgroup... ]
# This would be an ampty list: []
# You can validate your json here: http://jsonlint.com/

# There are six categories of mobs: monsters, creatures, water creatures, ambient creatures, water ambient creatures and miscellaneous.
