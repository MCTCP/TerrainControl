/**
 * Class to get the spawn height of objects part of a structure.
 * Three default implementations are provided.
 * <p />
 * Structures consist of multiple {@link StructuredCustomObject}s. Structures
 * can be quite big, so not all parts are in loaded chunks. An initial guess
 * of the y coordinate of all parts is made when starting a structure.
 * However, when the spawn height depends on the terrain this guess will be
 * incorrect. The purpose of this class is to correct the y location just
 * before the object is spawned.
 * <p />
 * It is up to the object that started the structure to provide the correct
 * implementation. Structures like villages want all their parts to be placed
 * on the surface, so they will always return the y position of the highest
 * block on the column as the correct location to spawn. Structures like
 * strongholds however have a random y (within limits) as a start position and
 * place all parts relative to the start, without depending on the terrain.
 * For them the guess is always correct, so they just return the given y
 * position.
